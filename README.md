# Exploratory Data Analysis using Visualizations
# Course
DS3001	Data Analysis and Visualization

# Data Description
You are required to use the attached NUCES admission stats of 2019. File contains data applicants of all over Pakistan for all the disciplines. There are many empty fields you should devise a mechanism to handle them. <br />

Tasks to perform:
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), also known as Data Exploration, is a step in the Data Analysis Process, where a number of techniques are used to better understand the dataset being used. ‘Understanding the dataset’ can refer to a number of things including but not limited to. <br />
<br />

• Extracting important variables and leaving behind useless variables. <br />
• Identifying outliers, missing values, or human error. <br />
• Understanding the relationship(s), or lack of, between variables. <br />
• Ultimately, maximizing your insights of a dataset and minimizing potential error that may occur later in the process. <br />
<br />

In short, EDA refers to performing visualizations & identifying significant patterns, such as correlatedfeatures, missing data, and outliers. EDA’s are also essential for providing hypotheses for why these patterns occur. <br />
<br />
As described earlier, the provided dataset is NUCES admission dataset. University administration is interested in knowing answers to the questions mentioned below to define better future policies. You are required to answer the following questions by using the tools taught in the class. None of the questions can be answered as Yes or No. You are required perform EDA to reach a conclusion. You may use 1D, 2D, and/or multivariate (visual) analysis to answer the below given questions. You have to draw conclusions from your analysis and write/explain your answers as well. <br />
